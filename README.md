# SiDCo
Signed DIstance Correlation analysis
Provided code is make freely accessible through our web site: https://complimet.ca/sidco
Code provided here includes RShiny GUI module: app.R complete python code for signed distance correlation calcuation: dCor.py and python code for partil distance correlation calculation in pdCor.py. Python code for the calculation of Spearman and Pearson correlation is in dCor_pearson_spearman.py
Distance correlation calculations are based on method first proposed: Székely, Gábor J.; Rizzo, Maria L.; Bakirov, Nail K. (2007). "Measuring and testing independence by correlation of distances". The Annals of Statistics. 35 (6): 2769–2794. arXiv:0803.4101. doi:10.1214/009053607000000505. S2CID 5661488.
